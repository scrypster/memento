## Memento MCP — Persistent Memory

The `memento` MCP server provides persistent cross-session memory. Use these tools proactively — don't wait to be asked.

**Store** (`store_memory`) when the user:
- States a preference or working style ("I prefer X", "always use Y format")
- Makes an architectural or technical decision
- Establishes project context that should survive session restarts
- Explicitly says "remember this" or similar

**Recall** (`recall_memory` or `find_related`) when:
- Starting a session for a known project — query for relevant context before diving in
- About to make a recommendation — check for existing preferences first
- The user asks about past decisions, choices, or "what did we decide about X"
- Something seems like it may have been discussed in a prior session

**Don't store:** transient debug output, in-progress exploration, or anything session-specific that won't matter next time.

Memories are searchable immediately after storing. Enrichment (entity/relationship extraction) runs asynchronously via local Ollama.
