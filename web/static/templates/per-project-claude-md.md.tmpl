## Memento — Project Workspace

This project uses the **{{CONNECTION_NAME}}** Memento workspace.

When using Memento MCP tools in this project, always pass `connection_id: "{{CONNECTION_ID}}"` to
scope reads and writes to the correct workspace.

Examples:
- `store_memory(content: "...", connection_id: "{{CONNECTION_ID}}")`
- `recall_memory(query: "...", connection_id: "{{CONNECTION_ID}}")`
- `find_related(query: "...", connection_id: "{{CONNECTION_ID}}")`

> Note: ID-based lookups (recall_memory with id=, update_memory, update_memory_state) route
> automatically — you do not need to pass connection_id for those.
